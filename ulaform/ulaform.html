<p><strong>Ulaform</strong> is a robust aplication which allows for easy
creation of forms that can be embedded into any web page. It also
provides forms in Horde_Block objects usable in any Horde application
or externally.  </p

<p>It supports all the field types native to the Horde Framework, such as text,
long-text, boolean, selection boxes, checkboxes, etc. It validates a user's
input, checking both the values inserted and whether all fields have been
completed. Its output can be then emailed to one or more recipients.</b>

<p>Some future additions include user defined actions other than emailing,
support for user defined javascript and file uploads.</p>
