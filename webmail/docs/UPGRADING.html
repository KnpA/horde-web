<p>These are instructions to upgrade from earlier Horde Groupware Webmail Edition
versions.  Please backup your existing data before running any of the steps
described below, you need the backups in case anything goes wrong with the
upgrade process, which cannot be reverted automatically. You can't use the
updated data with your old Horde Groupware Webmail Edition version anymore.</p>
<p>Please see below for changes between certain Horde Groupware versions that are
not covered by the update script.</p>
<p>The update script will automatically migrate database backends and update
configuration files. It will add new and changed configurations at the end of
existing configuration files, any changes done to old configuration files
won't get lost, but might get overridden by new settings. You might want to
check the updated configuration files after the update script has finished to
make sure that any customizations that you did to the old version still work
as expected.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.dist</span></tt> versions of the configuration files alway contain the most
recent reference settings and the settings documentation. If you experience
any problems with the configuration files after an update, or if you want
cleaner configuration files without all the updating code, you can create
fresh versions from the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.dist</span></tt> files.</p>
<p>These instructions are supposed to be used with a complete tarball of the new
Horde Groupware Webmail Edition version. They don't work if you use a patch
file to upgrade your installation, because the patch already contains all
configuration file changes that the update script is going to add.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Extract the tarball of the new version <strong>in parallel</strong> to the old
version. See the <a href="#id1" name="id2"><span class="problematic" id="id2">INSTALL_</span></a> file details how to unpack a tarball.</p>
<p>If you want to replace the old version with the new version eventually, you
should move the old version to a different place now and put the new
version in the place of the old one. You can still do this later, if you
want to, but you have to edit the configuration file then.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Start the setup script:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
./scripts/setup.php
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Choose the update option in the setup menu and answer the questions from
the setup script.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Prey.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If everything went fine and without any error messages, point your browser
to the URL of the new version and log in as an administrator. Go to the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Administration</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Setup</span></tt> screen and update all configurations that are
marked as being outdated.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If you want to replace the old version with the new one, and if you didn't
do this already in step 1, you can do it now. But you have to edit the
configuration file <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">config/conf.php</span></tt> manually and change the setting
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$conf['cookie']['path']</span></tt> to match the new URL path. Otherwise you won't
be able to login after you moved Horde Groupware Webmail Edition to a
different directory.</p>

<p>An address book which lists the users' most favourite recipients had been

<p>All memcache configuration has been moved to the $conf['memcache'] parameter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="application-hooks">
<h2><a name="application-hooks">Application Hooks</a></h2>
<p>All hooks that are specific to a single application have been moved to that
application's <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">config/hooks.php</span></tt> file. Split up your existing Hooks from
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">horde/config/hooks.php</span></tt> and move them to the correct application.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="group-hooks">
<h2><a name="group-hooks">Group Hooks</a></h2>
<p>The format for group hook functions has changed from
_group_hook_groupName($username) to _group_hook($groupName,
$userName).  So you will need to modify any existing group hook
functions in config/hooks.php for the new interface.</p>
<p>Alternatively, an example _group_hook() function is provided in
config/hooks.php that will call the old style hook functions for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="custom-themes">
<h2><a name="custom-themes">Custom Themes</a></h2>
<p>Themes no longer have <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">info.php</span></tt> files. If you have any custom
themes that provide their own images, you must add a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">themed_graphics</span></tt> file to the theme's directory (for all
applications the theme provides images for) in order for Horde to know
to use the custom images. The file can be empty or contain whatever
you wish; it simply needs to exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="static-log-out-links">
<h2><a name="static-log-out-links">Static Log out Links</a></h2>
<p>If you have hardcoded a log out link in any custom templates or menu
items, you must update it to use Horde::getServiceLink(). This is
because logging out is now protected by a token to avoid CSRF
exploits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unified-imap-quota-driver">
<h2><a name="unified-imap-quota-driver">Unified IMAP Quota Driver</a></h2>
<p>Separate quota drivers for Cyrus and Courier servers are no longer
necessary. These drivers have been replaced by a generic IMAP driver that
should also be suitable for other IMAP servers that support the QUOTA
extension. Update <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">config/servers.php</span></tt> and change the 'quota' =&gt; 'driver'
setting to 'imap'.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="user-defined-mailbox-icons">
<h2><a name="user-defined-mailbox-icons">User-Defined Mailbox Icons</a></h2>
<p>The usage of the hook <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_imp_hook_mbox_icons()</span></tt> has changed.  If you use this
hook, make sure you change your implementation so it returns the correct
value.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-message-list-format-hook">
<h2><a name="new-message-list-format-hook">New Message List Format Hook</a></h2>
<p>The new hook <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_imp_hook_msglist_format()</span></tt> has been added which allows the
formatting of a message entry in the mailbox message list to be altered
at the time the list is created.  This hook has made the following
configuration options obsolete:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$conf['mailbox']['show_attachments']
$conf['mailbox']['show_xpriority']
</pre>
<p>If you wish to continue using the functionality previously provided by these
options, you should activate the msglist_format hook in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">config/conf.php</span></tt>.
The sample hook contained in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">config/hooks.php</span></tt> contains the code necessary
to replicate the previous behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="spell-checking">
<h2><a name="spell-checking">Spell Checking</a></h2>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pspell</span></tt> driver is no longer supported since it does not work with
HTML messages.  If using pspell, you must upgrade to aspell version 0.60+.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="filters-sql-backend">
<h2><a name="filters-sql-backend">Filters SQL Backend</a></h2>
<p>An SQL table has been added than can optionally be used as a storage backend
for the filter rules. Using this backend no longer limits the number and size
of rules.</p>
<p>You have to execute the provided PHP script to migrate the existing rules from
the preferences backend to the new database table:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
php ingo/scripts/upgrades/convert_prefs_to_sql.php &lt; filename
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">filename</span></tt> is a file that contains a list of users, one username per line.
The username should be the same as how the preferences are stored in the
preferences backend (e.g. usernames may have to be in the form
<a class="reference" href="mailto:user&#64;example.com">user&#64;example.com</a>). You can create such a list with the following MySQL
command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
mysql --user=root --password=&lt;MySQL-root-password&gt; --skip-column-names --batch --execute='SELECT DISTINCT pref_uid FROM horde_prefs' &lt;db name&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="imsp-driver-and-share-support">
<h2><a name="imsp-driver-and-share-support">IMSP Driver and Share Support</a></h2>
<p>Share support has been added to the IMSP driver.  This support requires at
least a Horde 3.2 install.  With this change, any IMSP address books the user
has rights to will be represented internally as a Horde share.  Permissions
changed on the share will be reflected back to the IMSP server.  If you set
the configuration setting <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Name</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">source</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">creating</span> <span class="pre">new</span> <span class="pre">shares</span></tt> to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">imsp</span></tt> then any shares created by the user will result in a new IMSP address
book being created on the IMSP server.  Likewise, any IMSP address book
deleted in Turba will be removed from the IMSP server.</p>
<p>To enable this support, make sure you are using at least Horde 3.2, set the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">use_shares</span></tt> attribute to true, and uncomment the IMSP
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_horde_hook_share_*</span></tt> functions in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">horde/config/hooks.php</span></tt>.</p>
<p>With this change, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">IMSP</span> <span class="pre">Address</span> <span class="pre">Book</span> <span class="pre">Administration</span></tt> option page has
been removed, as the creation/deletion of address books is now handled with
shares.</p>
