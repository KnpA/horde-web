<ul class="simple">
<li>Merge functionality into Ingo.</li>
<li>There should be more error checking for various things, in particular sanity
checking of the form variables passed in.</li>
<li>Could check username/password submitted against horde's copy of the password
to make sure they match and if not reject it earlier.  Instead we are
currently waiting until the ftp connection fails to see if the password is
wrong.  This isn't very precise as the ftp connection could have failed for
other reasons.</li>
<li>It only is meant to work with one address to forward to, and may have
problems if you enter more than one address.  May need to address this in
both the form input (max length) and the forwards.php file (check for
problems?)</li>
