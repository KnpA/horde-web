<h1>Release notes for the latest release</h1><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Forwards Email
Forwarding Manager version H3 (3.0).

Forwards is a Horde module for setting user email forwards via the .forward
mechanism supported by several popular mailers.

Right now, Forwards provides fairly complete support for setting .forward
style forwards on Sendmail, Courier, or Qmail mail based systems via an FTP
transport. It now also has drivers for Mdaemon, Exim SQL, Exim LDAP, Custom
SQL, and SOAP based systems.

The major changes compared to the Forwards 2.2 versions are:
    * Compatible with Horde 3 and PHP 5.
    * Added custom SQL, LDAP, and SOAP drivers.
    * Added Persian and Czech translations.</pre>
