<h3>So you want to contribute?</h3>

<p>There are several ways you can contributing to Horde. We are always looking
for new poeple to help and not only in programming. There are plenty of
important tasks that don't involve writing or maintaining code, such as
documentation or localization.</p>

<p>As first steps you should:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Get the code.</strong><br />
      <a href="git.php">Clone the git repository</a>. It's important to always
      use git for new features.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Find a bug to solve or a feature to implement.</strong><br />
      Check the <a href="http://bugs.horde.org/">Horde Ticket Tracker</a> for
      any outstanding bugs or track down your own. It can be even missing
      documentation or translations.<br />
      If you decide to implement a new feature, it might be worth discussing
      it in the <a href="../mail/">lists</a> first, to test water, get feedback
      from lead developers and see if anybody is already working on it or if
      it fits at all into the general direction of the project. You can even
      have a look over at the <a href="../bounties/">bounties</a> page for
      inspiration.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Create a patch.</strong><br />
      See the instructions on the <a href="git.php#patch">Git page</a>.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Attach your patch to a new enhancement request in the <a
      href="http://bugs.horde.org/">Horde Ticket Tracker</a>.</strong><br />
      Be prepared to be met with a critical analysis of your patch.
      In case your patch is refused, ask why and either correct your
      patch or constructively argue your point. In case you receive no
      feedback, try bumping the issue once after a week. We make every
      effort to respond to all tickets, but please be patient. If your
      patch does not cleanly fit into Horde's main codebase, you may
      be asked to document it and upload it to a new <a
      href="http://wiki.horde.org/">Wiki page</a>.  That way it will
      be available in a central place to others with the same
      need.</li>
</ol>

<p>As general points to remember:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Respect the project coding standards, otherwise your patches will not be
      commited. You can find the coding standards in your horde directory
      under horde/docs/CODING_STANDARDS or directly from <a href="http://cvs.horde.org/co.php/horde/docs/CODING_STANDARDS">CVS</a>.</li>
  <li>Work within the framework, that is use the available classes and
      mechanisms (eg: preferences, permissions, forms, etc).</li>
  <li>Monitor the <a
      href="http://lists.horde.org/mailman/listinfo/dev">development</a> and <a
      href="http://lists.horde.org/mailman/listinfo/commits">commits</a>
      mailing lists and those of the applications you work on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, remember that, although you work on the project on your own
goodwill, this does not grant you any specific privileges. The lead developers
make the final call. Sometimes, they may make decisions that you may not agree
with. Obviously, you are entitled to voice your opinion and argue your point,
but stay civil, do not drag it out and respect their decisions.</p>

<p>That's pretty much it. One last thing: do not do it for an ego boost, do
it for the love of coding. The unfortunate truth is that contributing to an
OSS project will most likely never get you the kind of fame Linus Torvalds or
RMS enjoy, nonetheless, as with any Open Source project, your contribution
will be greatly appreciated by the community.</p>
