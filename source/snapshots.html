<p>Nightly <a href="http://snaps.horde.org/">Snapshots</a> (tarballs of development code) are now provided for Git HEAD (Horde 4 code) and most recent FRAMEWORK_3 branches (Horde 3 code) for all <a href="../source/modules.php">applications in the Horde repository</a>.  We keep approximately 7 days worth of snapshots, organized by date.</p>

<p>The Git HEAD snapshot of a module will almost always be development code, and may be unstable.  All modules have a HEAD snapshot, even if there has not yet been a release of the module.</p>

<p>The CVS FRAMEWORK_3 snapshot of a module is the release base for the module, and only exists for modules which have been released (Horde 3).  This code base will make up the next stable release of the code.</p>

<p>Snapshots are provided primarily for people who want to run development code but do not have access to (or familiarity with) either Git and/or CVS.</p>
