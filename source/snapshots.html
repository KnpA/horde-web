<p>Nightly CVS <a href="http://snaps.horde.org/">Snapshots</a> (tarballs of
the CVS code) are now provided for the CVS HEAD and most recent CVS RELENG_*
and FRAMEWORK_3 branches for all <a href="../source/modules.php">applications
in the Horde CVS repository</a>.  We keep approximately 7 days worth of
snapshots, organized by date.</p>

<p>The HEAD snapshot of a module will almost always be development code, and
may be unstable.  All modules have a HEAD snapshot, even if there has not yet
been a release of the module.</p>

<p>The FRAMEWORK_3 snapshot of a module is the release base for the module,
and only exists for modules which have been released.  This code base will
make up the next release of the code.</p>

<p>The RELENG_* snapshot of a module is the old release base for the module,
and only exists for modules which have been released.  This code base will
only be used for bugfix releases of old, deprecated versions, if at all.</p>

<p>Snapshots are provided primarily for people who want to run the CVS code
base but do not have access to (or familiarity with) the CVS utilities.</p>
