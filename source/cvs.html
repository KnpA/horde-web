<p>All of the code in our repository is split into a set of <a
href="modules.php">modules</a>. However, sometimes there are multiple
branches available of a module. A CVS branch is a mechanism for
keeping multiple versions of a module; for instance, a stable branch
and a development branch.</p>

<p>Our branches and release engineering can seem a little convoluted
at first, but follows some pretty simple rules. When you check
something out of CVS, by default, you get the HEAD branch. HEAD is
always the latest development code. It may be undocumented, it may be
broken, it may cause tofu to turn purple. You never know.</p>

<p>The branches that hold release versions of applications - code that is
documented, tested, and recommended for production use - are named
FRAMEWORK_3, where _3 means that this includes Horde 3.x and any applications
that are compatible to Horde 3. So, the release branch for IMP 4.x and Horde
3.x is both FRAMEWORK_3. Note that this doesn't give you a way to distinguish
between IMP 4.0 and IMP 4.1 - they live in the same CVS branch, because one
supercedes the other. However, we do tag releases, so you can check out IMP
4.0 with the IMP_4_0 tag.</p>

<p>There are some old branches available that hold old release versions of
applications, named RELENG_*, where * is the major version of the application
in question. So, the release branch for IMP 3.x is RELENG_3. The release
branch for Horde 2.x is RELENG_2. Note that this doesn't give you a way to
distinguish between IMP 3.0 and IMP 3.1 - they live in the same CVS branch,
because one supercedes the other. However, we do tag releases, so you can
check out IMP 3.0 with the IMP_3_0 tag.</p>

<h3>CVS Tools</h3>

<p>You can use the Horde CVS repository as an anonymous user, or as a
developer.</p>

<p>You will need a CVS client, if you don't already have one. CVS
should be installed with most modern Linux distributions, easily
available on *BSD systems, and there are clients for Win32, MacOS, and
GUI clients for the Unices. A number of them are available at <a
href="http://www.cvshome.org/">http://www.cvshome.org/</a>.</p>

<p>These command lines should be the bare-bones needed to get you
started with Horde and CVS; this is not a CVS tutorial, however. The
standard CVS documentation is available <a
href="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_toc.html">here</a>, and
there are many HOWTOs available on the web.</p>


<h3>Anonymous CVS</h3>

<p>Anonymous CVS access is available using pserver. To log in to the
server, use the following commands:</p>

<p>sh, ksh, bash, zsh:<blockquote><code>export CVSROOT=:pserver:cvsread@anoncvs.horde.org:/repository</code></blockquote></p>
<p>csh, tcsh:<blockquote><code>setenv CVSROOT :pserver:cvsread@anoncvs.horde.org:/repository</code></blockquote></p>

<p>then for all:<blockquote><pre class="literal-block">cvs login
(password: 'horde')</pre></blockquote></p>

<p>In order to reduce the load on our anonymous CVS server, and to
promote fairness amongst users who retrieve our source code via
anonymous CVS, each client host is limited to a maximum of four
connections a minute. The server supports a maximum of eight anonymous
CVS connections simultaneously.</p>


<h3>Developer CVS</h3>

<p>Access to the live CVS tree is only available over SSH. You must
set the CVS_RSH variable to ssh, or the location of the ssh binary on
your machine. You will probably want to create an SSH key and use that
with your account to avoid having to enter your password on every
checkout/update/commit. You will also have to set the CVSROOT
environment variable. For sh shells, here is the syntax:</p>

<p>sh, ksh, bash, zsh:<blockquote><code>export CVSROOT=username@cvs.horde.org:/repository</code></blockquote></p>
<p>csh, tcsh:<blockquote><code>setenv CVSROOT username@cvs.horde.org:/repository</code></blockquote></p>

<p>... where username is your cvs.horde.org account name.</p>


<h3>Checking code out</h3>

<p>Once you have performed the steps above, and you are sure the
CVSROOT environment variable is set correctly, you can check out a
module from CVS with this command:</p>

<code>cvs co [ -r &lt;TAG&gt; ] &lt;MODULE&gt;</code>

<p>where -r &lt;TAG&gt; is optional, and specifies a tag or branch to
check out (see <a href="index.php">the general CVS info</a> for what
the branches mean), and &lt;MODULE&gt; is one of the <a
href="modules.php">available modules</a>. The modules list also says
what tags are available for each module.</p>

<p>This will create a <tt>&lt;MODULE&gt;</tt> directory in your
current directory. It may take a bit of time, especially if your
network connection is slow or the module is an espeicially large
one. But once it is done, you will have an up to date copy of the
master CVS source for that module. You can then at any time cd into
this directory and type:</p>

<code>cvs update -Pd</code>

<p>to update your source tree to be in sync with the master tree. (The
-P means to prune empty directories,
and -d makes sure that you get new directories which have been added
to the repository since your last update/checkout).</p>
