<h1>Release notes for the latest release</h1><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Turba Contact
Manager version H3 (2.3.1). The original release was packaged with the wrong
name; this second release of 2.3.1 has no changes to the package or the code,
only to the version name.

This is a minor security release that fixes unescaped output in the test
script. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this release. In addition all
users are encouraged to disable test.php in production, per the install
documentation.

Turba is the Horde contact management application. It is a production level
address book, and makes heavy use of the Horde framework to provide
integration with IMP and other Horde applications. It supports SQL, LDAP,
Kolab, and IMSP address books.

The major changes compared to the Turba version H3 (2.3) are:
    * SECURITY: Escape output in test.php
    * A SquirrelMail contact import script.
    * Kolab fixes for free/busy URLs and photos.
    * prototype.js has been upgraded to 1.6.0.3.</pre>
