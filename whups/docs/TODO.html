<div class="line">&gt; What if we had a &quot;clone&quot; feature? When editing states/priorities, just</div>
<div class="line">&gt; being able to clone the states/priorities from another type into this</div>
<div class="line">&gt; type?</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">I now think that this would be a good idea.  It's almost the same as</div>
<div class="line">Gary's template patch, but it should work in a slightly different way</div>
<div class="line">to better fit the workflow direction.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">When we have state transitions, it's more important that a type</div>
<div class="line">doesn't change as tickets flow through it because that could cause</div>
<div class="line">tickets to become inconsistent.  However, it's very likely that as the</div>
<div class="line">type is being used, people see some way of making it fit the model</div>
<div class="line">more accurately.  In that case, probably the best way to fix it is to</div>
<div class="line">copy the existing type into a new one.  You can then modify the new</div>
<div class="line">type however you see fit then 'publish' the type and start creating</div>
<div class="line">tickets in it.  Published types can't be altered.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">With the type templates, you could only copy particular types into new</div>
<div class="line">ones, instead of any type that you need to.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">However, with the templates, type were created as 'just a template',</div>
<div class="line">ie. one that shouldn't have tickets created.  This can be quite</div>
<div class="line">useful, but instead of using an underscore prefix to identify it, I'd</div>
<div class="line">prefer to have a 'published' field in the table to represent types</div>
<div class="line">that can have tickets in it.  A template could then be a normal,</div>
<div class="line">unpublished, type.</div>
