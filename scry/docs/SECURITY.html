<p>A note on how Scry uses per-poll permissions:</p>
<p>PERMS_SHOW: Can see the poll and can vote on it.
PERMS_READ: With PERMS_SHOW can see poll results.
PERMS_EDIT: Can manage poll (change questions, conclude, etc).
PERMS_DELETE: Can delete poll.</p>
<p>To grant the ability for a user or group to be able to create their own polls,
add them with PERMS_ALL to scry:pollster.  Users who are pollsters may see any
poll they create, as well as any poll they would otherwise have PERMS_EDIT on.
Pollsters may only create polls for groups in which they belong.</p>
<p>To grant the ability of a user or group to manage ALL polls (including polls
they did not create), grant PERMS_ALL on scry:admin.  Admins can do anything to
any poll.  Admins automatically include Horde admins.</p>
