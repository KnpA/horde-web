<p><b>Note: Do NOT use the PEAR packages provided on this page for Horde
3.0.</b> Horde 3.0 requires PHP 4.3.0 that comes with a recent enough PEAR
version. Use PEAR's command line tool instead to update or install required
PEAR packages.</p>

<p>Horde 2.x, IMP 3.x, and all other Horde applications make use of
the <a href="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR libraries</a> to handle such
tasks as database abstraction, mail delivery and logging. These
libraries come bundled with PHP4. However, since PEAR is a rapidly
evolving target, not everyone who has a workable version of PHP4 has a
recent enough PEAR installation.</p>

<p>To make it easier for users to obtain the latest PEAR libraries, we
have provided an archive containing a version of PEAR which will work
with the latest Horde code. The package is available on our ftp site:
<br />.tar.gz: <a href="<?php echo $ftp_base ?>/pear/pear-1.3.tar.gz"><?php echo $ftp_base ?>/pear/pear-1.3.tar.gz</a>
<br />.tar.bz2: <a href="<?php echo $ftp_base ?>/pear/pear-1.3.tar.bz2"><?php echo $ftp_base ?>/pear/pear-1.3.tar.bz2</a>
<br />.zip: <a href="<?php echo $ftp_base ?>/pear/pear-1.3.zip"><?php echo $ftp_base ?>/pear/pear-1.3.zip</a>
</p>

<p><em>Since PEAR 1.3 (that is included in our pear-1.3 packages) a PHP
version of 4.2 or higher is required.  If you have an older PHP version, you
can try an <a href="<?php echo $ftp_base ?>/pear/old/">older PEAR package</a> like
pear-1.1.</em></p>

<p>To install this package simply backup your current
<tt>/usr/local/lib/php</tt> (or wherever PEAR lives on your system;
/usr/local/share/php/pear is another possibility) directory, and
uncompress the contents of the archive above into that same directory.</p>

<p><em>Note that you DO NOT need to recompile PHP to install these
libraries. Simply moving the new PEAR files into place will be
sufficient; they are just PHP scripts and no recompilation or
restarting of the server is necessary.</em></p>
