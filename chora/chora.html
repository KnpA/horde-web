<p>Chora is our tool for viewing code repositories that are managed using the
<a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a> or <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> source control systems. It
aims to provide a high degree of integration with CVS, SVN and the other Horde
web-based tools.</p>

<p>Right now, Chora comes close to matching existing CVS-Web scripts feature
for feature, and provides a solid base for future development.  Some exciting
new features include a <em>visual branch viewing</em> tool, which
intelligently displays the branch history of a given file. Branches have
traditionally been a source of confusion when using CVS, and this feature aims
to make it a bit clearer and easier to use.</p>

<p>Chora is designed from the ground-up with customisability in mind, since
Version Control Systems are used in a variety of different ways. Because of
this, all the repository manipulation logic is abstracted away in our
<em>VC</em> library module. The main PHP scripts are simple HTML rendering
scripts, while the complex repository logic is hidden away in the library.
This library can be used for a variety of other uses, such as searching for
commits, graph generation, change collation, etc (all features planned for
eventual inclusion into Chora).</p>
