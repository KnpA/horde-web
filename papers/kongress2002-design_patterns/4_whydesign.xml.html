  <p>
    Before we get into how to use design patterns, objects, and
    OO-design, it's worth discussing why we should be "designing" our
    PHP applications in the first place. PHP is a simple scripting
    language, some people say - you shouldn't ever need objects;
    functions and simple pages will do.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a lot of things, they certainly do. But there are a number of
    situations where you may want a higher level of organization:
  </p>

  <ul>
<li>Code intended to be used by others</li><li>Code being developed by a large development team</li><li>Code that you will have to maintain</li></ul><br />


  <p>
    Code intended for use by others: Any class libraries, applications
    that you want to distribute and expect others to modify, or
    similar code automatically have a higher standard of readability,
    documentation, and organization than the couple of scripts that
    you threw together to make your website a bit snazzier.
  </p>

  <p>
    Code being developed by a large team: Large development teams
    often are exactly analogous to the too many cooks, spoiling the
    broth. The only way to avoid constantly rewriting everyone's work
    is to have a plan and stick to it, and that means having a
    coherent design thought out from the outset. Will things still
    change, and will you likely forget something anyway? Yes. But
    you'll still save a huge amount of time and pain. "If you plan on
    having to rewrite your application once, you'll end up rewriting
    it twice. Plan on getting it right the first time, and you'll only
    rewrite it once."
  </p>

  <p>
    Code you have to maintain: This is your own skin, and sometimes
    it's necessary to get something out the door so quickly that you
    know it will come back to bite you later - I'm sure management has
    put all of us in that position. But if you have a choice in the
    matter, leaving yourself well-organized code will provide many
    more cues to your memory on how everything works.
