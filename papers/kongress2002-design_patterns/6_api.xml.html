  <p>
    An API, or an Application Programming Interface, is the way your
    application, or one of its components, interacts with any other
    code using it.
  </p>

  <p>
    That sentence implies an assumption that is one of the fundamental
    aspects of creating a well-designed application: when using
    components, you should use their APIs and not muck around with
    internals or include pages directly. And conversely, when writing
    an API, you must expose enough functionality that users can make
    full use of the API without having to muck with internals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is an example of an API for a Browser detection class: <a target="_blank" href="http://dev.horde.org/api/framework/Horde_Browser/Browser.html">http://dev.horde.org/api/framework/Horde_Browser/Browser.html</a>. It includes methods to do the things you'd expect of such a
    class, along with accessors for all of the member variables that
    you would want to access. Why is this important? Why go through
    the overhead of calling a function instead of just accessing
    things directly? Well, we recently changed some of the internal
    data structures/member variables of the class. And we had a few
    pieces of code that had been accessing member variables
    directly. Guess what: they all broke. Now that we have all of the
    appropriate accessors and are using them everywhere, even if we
    change the internal variables again, that won't happen.
  </p>

  <p>
    The other lesson to draw from this is that when someone changes
    how something works, they'll almost always fix anything that that
    change breaks in the same file - but tracking down any affected
    code outside of that file usually only happens bit by bit as
    people find breaks. So as much as you can insure that changes
    won't affect anything other than their immediate class - i.e.,
    don't change the API, and stick to the API - things will break
    that much less.
