    <para>
    Send Message launches your email to the intended recipient(s). Be sure you want to send before clicking here as once sent it cannot be taken back.
    </para>
    <para>
    Save Draft places an unfinished message in a folder called 'Drafts'
accessible by the pop-down box on the right side of the blue navigation bar at top. You can then finish the message later by switching to the 'Drafts' folder, clicking on the saved message to open it, and then clicking on 'Resume'. Be sure to put a subject on the email before you save the draft so that you can easily identify which message you want within the Drafts folder. After saving as a Draft, you are returned to your INBOX or whatever folder you were viewing last.
    </para>
    <para>
    Cancel Message drops the message in progress and simply returns you to the INBOX or whatever folder you were viewing last.
    </para>

<entry id="compose-from">
    <title>Message Composition: From</title>
    <heading>"From"</heading>
    <para>
    Enter your correct email address. Your email address is automatically entered for you following "From:" in outgoing email.
    </para>
</entry>

<entry id="compose-to">
    <title>Message Composition: To</title>
    <heading>"To"</heading>
    <para>
    Enter the correct email address(es) of those to receive your message. You must separate each address with a comma; other punctuation will result in an error. Your entry follows "To:" in outgoing mail.  
    </para>
</entry>

<entry id="compose-cc">
    <title>Message Composition: Cc</title>
    <heading>"Cc"</heading>
    <para>
    Enter the correct email address(es) of those to receive a carbon copy of your message. Separate each address with a comma. Your entry follows "Cc:" in outgoing mail. Carbon copies are usually sent to people other than the one(s) being written to directly but are important recipients of the email as well, usually someone indirectly concerned about the subject of the email.  All 'To:' recipients and 'Cc:' recipients can see the entire list of both kinds of recipients.
    </para>
</entry>

<entry id="compose-bcc">
    <title>Message Composition: Bcc</title>
    <heading>"Bcc"</heading>
    <para>
    Enter the correct email address(es) of those to receive a blind carbon copy of your message. You must separate each address with a comma; other punctuation will result in an error. Your entry follows "Bcc:" in outgoing mail. Blind carbon copies are usually sent to people other than direct and indirect recipients ("To:" and "Cc:" recipients) who need to read what is being written as well WITHOUT the other recipients knowing that they are receiving the email. Thus 'blind' means that the identity of these recipients is hidden from all other recipients of the email, and only you and they know they got a copy. You typically use this to tell an authority figure that you are telling someone something without alarming the person you are sending the actual email to.
    </para>
</entry>

<entry id="compose-subject">
    <title>Message Composition: Subject</title>
    <heading>"Subject"</heading>
    <para>
    Enter the subject of your message. Your entry follows "Subject:" in outgoing mail. Keep it short, simple and descriptive.  The subject line is the easiest way for you and your correspondents to remember what was in the email and thus is very important in organizing your email and finding important ones later.  Also, when you 'Reply' or 'Forward' and email this subject line is copied over into the new message and so is a valuable way of telling what messages go together to form a "thread" of a conversation.  However, if the 'Reply' or 'Forward' contains new ideas, you may want to add simple modifications to the 'Subject' line so the recipient(s) can follow the progression of the "thread."
    </para>

<entry id="compose-options">
    <title>Message Composition: Options</title>
    <heading>"Options"</heading>
    <para>

    </para>
    <para>
    Click "Spell Check" to check your spelling.
    </para>
    <para>
    Click "Attachments" to view at the bottom of the page a list of files attached to this message.
    </para>
    <para>
    Activate the check-button next to "Save copy" to save a copy of this message in your "Sent Mail" folder. Save copies of important emails you send so that you have something to refer back to later and to keep an accurate record of what was said. We do not recommend you save every email since then your disk storage quota will be used up quickly (especially when you send attachments) and your mailbox will be full and unable to receive new incoming email. You can, however, turn this feature 'on' as your default with 'Preferences' on the blue navigation bar at top. Be careful when using this modified default as you will need to periodically purge your "Sent Mail" folder or it will eventually make your mailbox full and unuseable.
