<p>Sesha is mostly complete, especially for just keeping track of inventory.</p>
<p>Here is an incomplete list of features that would be cool to have.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Remember previous category after editing a stock item</li>
<li>Search by Property Names, not just values</li>
<li>Implement API for adding, updating &amp; getting properties for items in inventory</li>
<li>Add a few new Horde_Form_Types like IP address and Turba contact so that all i
of the previous functionality from Sesha is present in this version.</li>
<li>More help(?)</li>
<li>Maybe a better summary that will include a set of user-defined properties to
show (probably will lag too much to implement)</li>
<li>Add another data field to allow an item to be purchased or not (or another
table all together)</li>
<li>Add a field allowing user to indicate how many of an item are in stock.</li>
<li>Consider crossover of this app with Merk (shopping cart)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not set in stone, but if Sesha is going to be used to keep up with a
<em>store's</em> inventory, these features would be nice to have. If it is nothing
more than to keep track of a few things that are lying around, Sesha is
already set to rock and roll.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
