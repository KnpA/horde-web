<ul class="simple">
<li>Add support for managing &quot;time pools&quot; such as vacation time and sick days.</li>
<li>Add a request and approval mechanism (for some time pools, such as
vacation).</li>
<li>Add employee expenses.  Allow them to be billed to clients.  Add search
and export ability for them.</li>
<li>Add &quot;Don't know&quot; to &quot;Billable?&quot; options.  A manager must review and decide
on all time before exporting.</li>
<li>Allow selection of which fields to display for clients.</li>
<li>Separate &quot;review&quot; permission into &quot;Other People's Time&quot; and &quot;Submitted Time&quot;
permissions (and &quot;Other People's Submitted Time&quot;?)</li>
<li>Preference to select a new entry mode where user can enter start time and
end time (instead of number of hours).</li>
<li>The client list can get quite large.  Keep the last ten MRU in the drop
down box, with a sixth option being &quot;More...&quot;.  Javascript will pop open a
window with the full list (or a search window?) to cycle one into the MRU.</li>
