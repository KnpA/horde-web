<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Kronolith
Calendar Application version H4 (3.0).

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides web-based calendars
backed by a SQL database or a Kolab server. Supported features include Ajax and
mobile interfaces, shared calendars, remote calendars, invitation management
(iCalendar/iTip), free/busy management, resource management, alarms, recurring
events, and a sophisticated day/week view which handles arbitrary numbers of
overlapping events.

To install Kronolith, you need to install Horde first. See
https://github.com/horde/horde/blob/master/horde/docs/INSTALL for details. Once
Horde is installed, you can install Kronolith with the following command:

Then log in to Horde with your adminstrator account to configure the
application and install the database schema from the configuration interface.
