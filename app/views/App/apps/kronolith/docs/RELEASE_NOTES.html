<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first beta release of the Kronolith
Calendar Application version H5 (4.1.0).

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides web-based calendars
backed by a SQL database or a Kolab server. Supported features include Ajax and
mobile interfaces, shared calendars, remote calendars, invitation management
(iCalendar/iTip), free/busy management, resource management, alarms, recurring
events, and a sophisticated day/week view which handles arbitrary numbers of
overlapping events. For more information on Kronolith, visit
http://www.horde.org/apps/kronolith.

Testing is requested and comments are encouraged.
Updated translations would also be great.

The major changes compared to the Kronolith H5 (4.0) versions are:
    * Added CalDAV server support.
    * Small improvements.</pre>
