<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release candidate of the
Kronolith Calendar Application version H4 (3.0).

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides web-based calendars
backed by a SQL database or a Kolab server. Supported features include Ajax and
mobile interfaces, shared calendars, remote calendars, invitation management
(iCalendar/iTip), free/busy management, resource management, alarms, recurring
events, and a sophisticated day/week view which handles arbitrary numbers of
overlapping events.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome.

To install Kronolith, you need to install Horde first. See
https://github.com/horde/horde/blob/master/horde/docs/INSTALL for details. Once
Horde is installed, you can install Kronolith with the following command:

  pear install horde/kronolith-beta

Then log in to Horde with your adminstrator account to configure the
application and install the database schema from the configuration interface.
