<h3>Kronolith Case Study from Rick Emery</h3>

<p>I work for a law enforcement agency with an aviation unit (three
helicopters).  The shifts are 12.25 hours long, from 5:45 until 6:00
(5:45 am until 6:00 pm and 5:45 pm until 6:00 am). There are at least
two aircrew on duty at a time, one pilot and one flight officer (the
pilot flies while the flight officer does everything else; e.g. radio
communication, camera/VCR, binoculars, FLIR, spotlight, etc). There
are two full-time night-time flight officers and numerous volunteer
day-time flight officers, many from different agencies (I work for the
county sheriff's office, others work for city police departments
within the county, and some work for the highway patrol).</p>

<p>The guy coordinating the schedule requests a list of days that each
volunteer flight officer can work, and builds a schedule from that
list. Until I started working out there, he was doing the schedule
using Microsoft Word calendar wizard. He would complete the schedule
(there were always some vacant days), email it to each flight officer,
print it, and post it on the wall at the hangar. Flight officers were
encouraged to write their names in on vacant days that they could
work. The problem is that an updated schedule was never sent out to
the flight officers, so the updates could only be seen by driving out
to the hangar to look at the schedule. Additionally, the schedule
would sometimes need to be changed. The changes were sometimes handled
by the scheduler from home. Let me explain this problem with an
example.</p>

<p>I was scheduled to work Oct 22. After the schedule was posted, the
scheduler called me and asked me to work Oct 15 instead, and I
agreed. When I showed up on the 15, I saw that the change was never
made on the schedule and they had gotten someone else to cover it; our
phone conversation had apparently been forgotten. This was just an
inconvenience, but could have gone the other way where I wouldn't have
shown up on a day they thought I was scheduled.</p>

<p>I tried to come up with a solution that would make the schedule
available online, so that I (and the rest of the volunteers) could
periodically check it and verify the days we were expected to work. It
would also provide a continually updated list of vacant days for which
to sign up.</p>

<p>At first, we tried putting the calendar (the Word files) on a
network share.  This, however, prevented anyone from checking the
schedule from home.</p>

<p>Next, we created a calendar in the public folders section of our
Exchange server (we use Outlook for the Web to access stuff from
home). However, flight officers from other agencies couldn't access
it.</p>

<p>That's when it occured to me: With kronolith, I was using a
calendar that was accessible from any internet-connected
computer. With the permissions system that was in place, and the
categories, it was perfect.</p>

<p>So, I created an account on my server for the scheduler, used that
account to create a "flight officer" calendar, and set up categories
with different colors for each of the four shifts and "vacant". I set
his options so that it used kronolith for the application to show on
login, and changed his horde preference to hide the side menubar (I
have limited storage space and didn't want him to start using my
server as a public email system). I then made kronolith available to
guests, and gave them read access to the flight officer calendar.</p>

<p>It's worked out beautifully so far. He can make changes to the
calendar from home or work. All of the flight officers can access the
schedule from any intenet-connected computer through guest services,
and can even print it. The scheduler is very pleased, and (with the
color-coded categories) thinks it looks much better than anything he
came up with using Word or Outlook. It's worked out better than I
could have hoped. I'm even thinking about setting up another calendar
just for him so that he can enter everybody's available days, then
show it side-by-side with the schedule (if that's possible; I'm still
looking into it).<p>

<p>This extremely long missive is simply my way of saying a great big
*THANKS* to everybody for all of the hard work. Horde (and its apps)
is the best software product I've experienced; it's certainly the one
I use most!</p>
