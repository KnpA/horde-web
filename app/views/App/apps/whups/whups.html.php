<p>Whups is Horde's ticket-tracking application. It is very flexible in
design, and can be used for help-desk requests, tracking sofware development,
and anything else that needs to track a set of requests and their status.</p>

<p>Whups is also the engine behind <a
href="http://bugs.horde.org/">http://bugs.horde.org/</a>, as we believe in
using our own software - if Whups is as neat as we think it is, we should use
it! You should always be able to find a relatively recent copy of Whups on the
bugs site, and we use many of the advanced features there.</p>
