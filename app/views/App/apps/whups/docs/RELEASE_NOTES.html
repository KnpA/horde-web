<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the second release candidate of the Whups
Ticket Tracking System version H4 (2.0-RC2).

Whups is a Horde ticket-tracking application. It is very flexible in design,
and can be used for help-desk requests, tracking software development, and
anything else that needs to track a set of requests and their status.

Barring any problems, this code will be released as Whups H4 (2.0).
Testing is requested and comments are encouraged.
Updated translations would also be great.

Major changes compared to the Whups version H4 (2.0-RC1) are:
    * Support complex attributes types.
    * Allow to create private comments during ticket creation.
    * Small bugfixes and improvements.</pre>
