<ul class="simple">
<li>Better checks for bulk and mailing lists in vacation.</li>
<li>A smart composite driver that would let you define seperate drivers for
forwards, vacation, and filters.  Should also define the order of those
backends so that Ingo only allows re-arranging of rule order within the
correct bounds.</li>
</ul>
