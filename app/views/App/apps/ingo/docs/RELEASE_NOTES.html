<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first beta release of the Ingo Email
Filter Rules Manager version H5 (3.1.0).

Ingo is an email-filter management application. It is fully internationalized,
integrated with Horde and the IMP Webmail client, and supports both server-side
(Sieve, Procmail, Maildrop) and client-side (IMAP) message filtering. For more
information on Ingo, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/ingo.

Testing is requested and comments are encouraged.
Updated translations would also be great.

The major changes compared to the Ingo H5 (3.0) versions are:
    * Composite script and transport backends.
    * Added vacation driver for ISPConfig and custom SQL queries.
    * Small improvements.</pre>
