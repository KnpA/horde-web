<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release candidate of the Ingo
Email Filter Rules Manager version H4 (2.0).

Ingo is an email-filter management application. It is fully internationalized,
integrated with Horde and the IMP Webmail client, and supports both server-side
(Sieve, procmail) and client-side (IMAP) message filtering.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome.

To install Ingo, you need to install Horde first. See
https://github.com/horde/horde/blob/master/horde/docs/INSTALL for details. Once
Horde is installed, you can install Ingo with the following command:

  pear install horde/ingo-beta

Then log in to Horde with your adminstrator account to configure the
application and install the database schema from the configuration interface.

The major changes compared to the Ingo version H4 (2.0-RC1) are:

    * Fixed updating forward rules in SQL driver.
