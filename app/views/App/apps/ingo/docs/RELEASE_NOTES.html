<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Ingo Email
Filter Rules Manager version H4 (2.0).

Ingo is an email-filter management application. It is fully internationalized,
integrated with Horde and the IMP Webmail client, and supports both server-side
(Sieve, procmail) and client-side (IMAP) message filtering.

To install Ingo, you need to install Horde first. See
https://github.com/horde/horde/blob/master/horde/docs/INSTALL for details. Once
Horde is installed, you can install Ingo with the following command:

  pear install horde/ingo

Then log in to Horde with your adminstrator account to configure the
application and install the database schema from the configuration interface.

The major changes compared to the Ingo version H4 (2.0-RC2) are:

    * Changed default Sieve port to 4190.
    * Many small bugfixes and improvements.

The major changes compared to the Ingo version H3 (1.2) are:

    * Updated for Horde 4.
    * Using IMP API for IMAP filtering.
    * Changed default Sieve port to 4190.
