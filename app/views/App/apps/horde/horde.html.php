<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>Horde makes heavy use of <a href="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR</a>, the
<b>P</b>HP <b>E</b>xtension and <b>A</b>pplication <b>R</b>epository. PEAR is
a set of reuseable PHP components providing things such as Logging, Database
abstraction, and much more. Horde's <a href="docs/?f=INSTALL.html">INSTALL
File</a> provides instructions on how to correctly configure your system for
use with PEAR.</p>
