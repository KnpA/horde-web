<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Wicked wiki
application version H4 (1.0.2).

Wicked is a wiki application for the Horde Framework. It uses PEAR's Text_Wiki
library for the actual wiki markup parsing and rendering. It supports Creole,
Mediawiki, Tiki Wiki, and its own markup engine.

The major changes compared to the Wicked version H4 (1.0.1) are:
    * Fixed accidental deletion of all attachments when deleting a page.
    * Fixed permission check that didn't allow renaming or merging pages even
      with sufficient permissions.</pre>
