<p>MIMP is a project to create a version of
<?php echo $this->linkTo('IMP', array('controller' => 'app', 'action' => 'app', 'app' => 'imp'))?> 
suitable for small mobile devices such as WAP phones or PDAs. Basic IMP
functionality is implemented including mailbox viewing and paging, viewing
messages, deleting, replying, forwarding, and composing new
messages.</p>

<p>As of <?php echo $this->linkTo('IMP 5.0', array('controller' => 'app', 'action' => 'app', 'app' => 'imp'))?>
, the MIMP display, as well as an expanded mobile interface for smartphones has
been fully incorporated into IMP. All support and development questions are
handled through the IMP project.</p>
