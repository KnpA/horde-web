<p>MIMP is a project to create a version of <a href="../imp/">IMP</a>
suitable for mobile devices such as WAP phones or PDAs. Basic IMP functionality
is implemented including mailbox viewing and paging, viewing
messages, deleting, replying, forwarding, and composing new
messages.</p>

<p>As of <a href="/imp/roadmap/">IMP 5.0</a>, the MIMP display has been
fully incorporated into IMP. All support and development questions are
handled through the IMP project.</p>
