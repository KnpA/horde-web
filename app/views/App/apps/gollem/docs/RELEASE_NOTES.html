<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the second release candidate of the
Gollem File Manager version H5 (3.0.0).

Gollem is a web-based file manager, providing the ability to fully manage a
hierarchical file system stored in a variety of backends such as a SQL
database, as part of a real filesystem, or on FTP, Samba or SSH servers. For
more information on Gollem, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/gollem.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome.

The major changes compared to Gollem version H5 (3.0.0RC1) are:
    * Changed recursive deletion preference to ask by default.
    * Fixed downloading if backend key doesn't match driver name.
    * Updated Basque translation.
    * Further bugfixes and improvements.</pre>
