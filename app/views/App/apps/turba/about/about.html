<h3>What is Turba?</h3>

<p>Turba is a set of <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> scripts that
implement a contacts directory and management interface. Turba also
provides an API for external applications to interface with address
books, providing adding and searching features that you can hook right
into other applications.</p>

<h3>What does it require?</h3>
<p><b>Absolute requirements</b>: A web server running a recent PHP4
with support for either LDAP or a database with a PEAR driver, and
recent (CVS or snapshot) version of PEAR.</p>

<p><b>More or less absolute</b> (ie, you'd have to do serious code
revision to get by without): A browser capable of a reasonable level
of javascript and tables.</p>

<h3>Can I try it?</h3>
<p>There is no demo available yet.</p>

<h3>Where can I see the code?</h3>
<p>You can browse the current source tree online. <a
href="http://cvs.horde.org/turba/">Chora</a>, Horde's
web-based cvs frontend written in PHP, lets you go through the source
tree and view the current code, as well as what's changed from version
to version.</p>
