<p>These are instructions to upgrade from earlier Turba versions. Please backup
your existing data before running any of the steps described below. You can't
use the updated data with your old Turba version anymore.</p>
<p>After updating to a newer Turba version, you <strong>always</strong> need to update
configurations and database schemes. Log in as an administrator, go to
Administration =&gt; Configuration and update anything that's highlighted as
outdated.</p>

<div class="important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p class="last">These upgrade instructions assume that you are upgrading from
at least Turba 2.1.  If you have an older version of Turba,

first.</p>

<div class="section" id="new-default-schema">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Default Schema</a></h2>
<p>The default database address book schema has been changed to better match
other address book applications and to ease synchronization with those.</p>
<p>You can still use your old address book schema without any restrictions, but
if you want to migrate existing address books to the new default scheme, you
can use the provided upgrade script. This script assumes that you use the old
default schema from Turba 2.1 and doesn't permanently change any data unless
you edit it.</p>
<p>To run the script you have to open it in any text editor and change the three
variables at the top of the script <tt class="docutils literal">$db_user</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">$db_pass</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">$db_table</tt> to fit your current Turba installation. You can then run the
script to see how the data //would// be changed:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
php scripts/upgrades/2.1_to_2.2_sql_schema.php
</pre>
<p>If you are happy with the results, you can edit the script again and change
the <tt class="docutils literal">$for_real</tt> variable:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$for_real = true;
</pre>
<p>As always make sure you have a recent backup before running the script once
more, this time the changes will be permanent. Don't forget to update your
configuration files or to re-create them from the <tt class="docutils literal">.php.dist</tt> examples.</p>
<p>A few advanced attribute definitions have been commented out in
<tt class="docutils literal">config/attributes.php</tt> by default because they require Horde 3.2 or later
to be installed. If you have a sufficiently recent Horde version you can
uncomment those lines in <tt class="docutils literal">attributes.php</tt>.</p>
<p>As part of the new default schema, the various address fields have been split
into individual fields (such as homeStreet, homeProvince etc...). If you still
wish to display an individual composite address field (which will give you the
map links) you must add a composite field (such as homeAddress). There is an
example entry in the sources.php.dist file.</p>
<p>The new schema also uses the &quot;phone&quot; field type that has been introduced with
Horde 3.2. If you still run earlier Horde versions, change the phone field
types in <tt class="docutils literal">attributes.php</tt> to anything that fits your needs, e.g &quot;cellphone&quot;
or &quot;text&quot;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-beta-sql-share-driver-support">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Beta SQL Share Driver Support</a></h2>
<p>A new beta-level SQL Horde_Share driver has been added in Horde 3.2. This
driver offers significant performance improvements over the existing Datatree
driver but it has not received the same level of testing, thus the beta
designation.  In order to make use of this driver, you must be running Horde
3.2-RC3 or later. To add the new SQL tables for this driver, execute the sql
script <tt class="docutils literal">2.1_to_2.2_add_sql_share_tables</tt> that is appropriate for your
RDBMS. You then must execute the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">turba-convert-datatree-shares-to-sql</span></tt>
upgrade script to migrate your existing share data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="flattened-horde-shares">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flattened Horde Shares</a></h2>
<p>Shared address books are now stored in a flat namespace in order
to remove dependency on the hierarchal properties of the Horde_Share api.  You
must run the upgrade script <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">scripts/upgrades/2007-06-17_flatten_shares.php</span></tt>.</p>

<p>All user preferences related to address books will be checked and updated by
Turba transparently during each user's first login after the update.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you are currently using the configuration setting,
<tt class="docutils literal">Name of Client Address Book</tt> and have it set to a share enabled source, you
will most likely have to change the entry.  The correct share key to enter here
is the share name and can be found by browsing the datatree via the
administration UI if using datatree shares, or by looking in the turba_shares
table if using SQL based shares.</p>

<div class="section" id="imsp-driver-and-share-support">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMSP Driver and Share Support</a></h2>
<p>Share support has been added to the IMSP driver.  This support requires at
least a Horde 3.2 install.  With this change, any IMSP address books the user
has rights to will be represented internally as a Horde share.  Permissions
changed on the share will be reflected back to the IMSP server.  If you set
the configuration setting <tt class="docutils literal">Name of source for creating new shares</tt> to
<tt class="docutils literal">imsp</tt> then any shares created by the user will result in a new IMSP address
book being created on the IMSP server.  Likewise, any IMSP address book
deleted in Turba will be removed from the IMSP server.</p>
<p>To enable this support, make sure you are using at least Horde 3.2, set the
<tt class="docutils literal">use_shares</tt> attribute to true, and uncomment the IMSP
<tt class="docutils literal">_horde_hook_share_*</tt> functions in <tt class="docutils literal">horde/config/hooks.php</tt>.</p>
<p>With this change, the <tt class="docutils literal">IMSP Address Book Administration</tt> option page has
been removed, as the creation/deletion of address books is now handled with
shares.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Synchronization Support</a></h2>
<p>Synchronization with SyncML capable devices is possible now if you have at
least Horde 3.1.  You need to create a History backend with
<tt class="docutils literal">horde/scripts/sql/horde_histories.sql</tt> to allow synchronization.  You also
need to create default history entries for existing contacts by running the

<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">_turba_hook_encode_{attribute}</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">_turba_hook_decode_{attribute}</tt>
functions are now passed an additional parameter - the object that is being
loaded/saved. This enables you to create more powerful custom hooks that build
a field from several other field's values (the opposite of composite fields),
or otherwise modify a value based on other properties of the object.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="share-support">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share Support</a></h2>
<p>Share support has been added to Turba.  This allows the sharing, adding, and
deleting of addressbooks for those sources that support it.  Currently, this is
supported by the SQL driver.  With this change, the <tt class="docutils literal">public</tt> attribute of the
params array has been removed in favor of the <tt class="docutils literal">use_share</tt> attribute.  If you
are currently using a SQL source as a public source, you must run the upgrade
script <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">turba-public-to-horde-share</span></tt>.  Be sure to read the script comments
and backup all data before conversion.  This script will create a new share
that is viewable by all users.  If you choose not to use shares, set the
<tt class="docutils literal">use_shares</tt> attribute to <tt class="docutils literal">false</tt> and the SQL driver will behave as in
previous versions, that is, a seperate, private addressbook for each user.</p>
<div class="important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p class="last">If you are currently using two seperate <tt class="docutils literal">turba_objects</tt> tables
- one for personal address books and one for a public address
book, you should run the upgrade script on the public table,
then merge the public table into the private table and enable
share support on the private table.  There is no longer any
need for maintaining the two seperate tables. If you desire not
to enable share support, you may still use seperate tables and
set permissions via the administration interface.</p>
