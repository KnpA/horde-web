<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Turba Contact

Turba is the Horde contact management application. Leveraging the Horde

Then log in to Horde with your adminstrator account to configure the
application and install the database schema from the configuration interface.
