<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release candidate of the Turba
Contact Manager version H4 (3.0).

Turba is the Horde contact management application. Leveraging the Horde
framework to provide seamless integration with IMP and other Horde
applications, it supports storing contacts in SQL, LDAP, Kolab, and IMSP
address books.

tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome.

Horde is installed, you can install Turba with the following command:

Then log in to Horde with your adminstrator account to configure the
application and install the database schema from the configuration interface.
