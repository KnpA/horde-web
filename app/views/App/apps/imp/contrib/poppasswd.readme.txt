I have successfully tested it on my test machine with RH4.2 and a poppassd
that is talking to /bin/passwd. Any other tests apreciated.
  
/* poppassd config */
$default->use_poppassd              = true;
$default->poppassd_server           = 'localhost';
$default->poppassd_port             = 106;
  
must be added to config/defaults.php3 for it to work. The password server
must
be explictly set here to disallow attacks using the IMP box, but should be
trival to set it so that it uses the user's IMAP server.
  
Altough getpass() and getuser() are used for the acutal processing, the
user
must enter them again, to prevent the 'left-my-desk-to-go-to-WC'
situation.
  
Help-messages and a small icon for it will follow.
