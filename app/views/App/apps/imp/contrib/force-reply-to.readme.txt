This patch adds a variable to defaults object instance which is used as a
check to see if the reply-to field (from) should come from the database even
though the user cannot change their from line.

If there is enough interest in this patch, it seems like a relatively small 
section of code to apply another conditional check on and it could possibly
be added to the imp.
