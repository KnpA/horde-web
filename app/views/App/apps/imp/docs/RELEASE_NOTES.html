<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the
Internet Mail Program (IMP) version H5 (6.0.0).

IMP, the Internet Mail Program, is one of the most popular and widely deployed
open source webmail applications in the world. It allows universal, web-based
access to IMAP and POP3 mail servers and provides Ajax, mobile and basic
interfaces with a rich range of features normally found only in desktop email
clients. For more information on IMP, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/imp.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome. Strings are not going
to change until the final release.

The final release of IMP H5 (6.0.0) is expected on October 30.

The major changes compared to the IMP version H5 (6.0.0beta4) are:
    * Display message range when dragging slider on dynamic mailbox page.
    * Small bugfixes and improvements.</pre>
