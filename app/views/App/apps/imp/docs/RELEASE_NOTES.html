<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the last beta release of the Internet
Mail Program (IMP) version H5 (6.0.0).

IMP, the Internet Mail Program, is one of the most popular and widely deployed
open source webmail applications in the world. It allows universal, web-based
access to IMAP and POP3 mail servers and provides Ajax, mobile and basic
interfaces with a rich range of features normally found only in desktop email
clients. For more information on IMP, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/imp.

IMPORTANT! This is a preview version that should not be used on production
systems. This version is feature complete but there are likely to be bugs. You
should not use this preview version with existing production data.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the release candidates are prepared.

The major changes compared to the IMP version H5 (6.0.0beta3) are:
    * Added address autocompletion to smartphone mode.
    * Added swipe actions to the smartphone mailbox.
    * Simplified ACL management.
    * Many bugfixes and improvements.</pre>
