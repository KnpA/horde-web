<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release candidate of the
Internet Mail Program (IMP) version H4 (5.0).

IMP, the Internet Mail Program, is one of the most popular and widely deployed
open source webmail applications in the world. It allows universal, web-based
access to IMAP and POP3 mail servers and provides Ajax, mobile and traditional
interfaces with a rich range of features normally found only in desktop email
clients.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome.

To install IMP, you need to install Horde first. See
https://github.com/horde/horde/blob/master/horde/docs/INSTALL for details. Once
Horde is installed, you can install IMP with the following command:

  pear install horde/imp-beta

Then log in to Horde with your adminstrator account to configure the
application and install the database schema from the configuration interface.

The major changes compared to the IMP version H4 (5.0-RC1) are:

    * Improved vertical layout.
    * Improved key navigation.
    * Support importing of compressed mailbox files.
    * Many small bugfixes and improvements.

The full list of changes (from version H4 (5.0-RC1)) can be viewed here:
