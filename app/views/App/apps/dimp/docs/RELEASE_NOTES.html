<h1>Release notes for the latest release</h1><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Dynamic
Internet Messaging Program (DIMP) version H3 (1.1.6).

DIMP (Dynamic Internet Messaging Program, or Dynamic IMP) is a PHP-based
webmail system and a component of the Horde project.  DIMP is a version of the
webmail client IMP utilizing AJAX-like technologies to allow a more dynamic
user experience than traditionally offered via IMP.

DIMP requires at least Horde version 3.2 and IMP version H3 (4.2) to run.
Although not required to upgrade either Horde or IMP, it is STRONGLY
RECOMMENDED you do as any bugfixes to core functionality will occur in
these applications.

The major changes compared to DIMP version H3 (1.1.5) are:
    * Fixed the redirection to the login screen when the session times out.</pre>
