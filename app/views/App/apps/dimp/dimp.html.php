<p>DIMP is a project to create a version of <a href="../imp/">IMP</a>
utilizing AJAX-like technologies to allow a more dynamic user
experience (thus DIMP... <strong>D</strong>ynamic <strong>IMP</strong>).</p>

<p>As of <a href="/imp/roadmap/">IMP 5.0</a>, the DIMP display has been
fully incorporated into IMP. All support and development questions are
handled through the IMP project.</p>

<p class="hint">DIMP's development is generously sponsored
by <a href="http://softwarelivre.sapo.pt/">Portugal Telecom's SAPO
division</a>.</p>
