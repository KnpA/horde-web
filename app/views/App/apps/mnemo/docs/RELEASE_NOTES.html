<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first beta release of the Mnemo Note
Manager version H5 (4.0.0).

The Mnemo Note Manager is the Horde notes/memos application. It allows users to
keep web-based notes and freeform text. Notes may be shared with other users
via shared notepads. It requires the Horde Application Framework and an SQL
database or Kolab server for backend storage. For more information on Mnemo,
visit http://www.horde.org/apps/mnemo.

IMPORTANT! This is a preview version that should not be used on production
systems. This version is feature complete but there are likely to be bugs. You
should not use this preview version with existing production data.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the release candidates are prepared.

The major changes compared to the Mnemo version H4 (3.0) are:
    * Completely redesigned user interface.
    * Further bugfixes and improvements.</pre>
