<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Mnemo Note
Manager version H4 (3.0).

The Mnemo Note Manager is the Horde notes/memos application. It allows users to
keep web-based notes and freeform text. Notes may be shared with other users
via shared notepads. It requires the Horde Application Framework and an SQL
database or Kolab server for backend storage.

To install Mnemo, you need to install Horde first. See
https://github.com/horde/horde/blob/master/horde/docs/INSTALL for details. Once
Horde is installed, you can install Mnemo with the following command:

  pear install horde/mnemo

Then log in to Horde with your adminstrator account to configure the
application and install the database schema from the configuration interface.

The major changes compared to the Mnemo version H4 (3.0-RC2) are:

    * Default sorting criteria by creation date.
    * Many small bugfixes and improvements.

Have fun!

The Horde Team.</pre>
