<h1>Release notes for the latest release</h1><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Mnemo Note
Manager version H3 (2.2.4).

The Mnemo Note Manager is the Horde notes/memos application.  It provides
web-based notes and freeform text, similar to the PalmOS Note application and
shared notepads.  It requires the Horde Application Framework and an SQL
database or Kolab server for backend storage.

Major changes compared to the Mnemo H3 (2.2.3) version are:
    * Minor bugfixes and improvements.
    * Updated French and Japanese translations.</pre>
