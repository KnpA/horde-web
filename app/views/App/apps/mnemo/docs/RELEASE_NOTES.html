<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the second release candidate of the Mnemo
Note Manager version H5 (4.2.0).

The Mnemo Note Manager is the Horde notes/memos application. It allows users to
keep web-based notes and freeform text. Notes may be shared with other users
via shared notepads. It requires the Horde Application Framework and an SQL
database or Kolab server for backend storage. For more information on Mnemo,

Barring any problems, this code will be released as Mnemo H5 (4.2.0).  We
encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, strings should not
change before the final release.
