<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first beta release of the Nag Task
List Manager version H5 (4.1.0).

Nag is a web-based application built upon the Horde Application Framework which
provides a simple, clean interface for managing online task lists (i.e., todo
lists). It also includes strong integration with the other Horde applications
and allows users to share task lists or enable light-weight project management.

Testing is requested and comments are encouraged.
Updated translations would also be great.

The major changes compared to the Nag H5 (4.0) versions are:
    * Added CalDAV server support.
    * Small improvements.</pre>
