<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the last beta release of the Nag Task
List Manager version H5 (4.0.0).

Nag is a web-based application built upon the Horde Application Framework which
provides a simple, clean interface for managing online task lists (i.e., todo
lists). It also includes strong integration with the other Horde applications
and allows users to share task lists or enable light-weight project management.

IMPORTANT! This is a preview version that should not be used on production
systems. This version is feature complete but there are likely to be bugs. You
should not use this preview version with existing production data.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the release candidates are prepared.

The major changes compared to the Nag version H5 (4.0.0beta1) are:
    * Added login task to purge completed tasks.
    * Completed interface redesign.
    * Synchronized tags with Kolab categories.
    * Further bugfixes and improvements.</pre>
