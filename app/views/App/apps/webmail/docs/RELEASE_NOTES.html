<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Horde Groupware
Webmail Edition version 5.2.4.

Horde Groupware Webmail Edition is a free, enterprise ready, browser based
communication suite. Users can read, send and organize email messages with four
different webmail interfaces and manage and share calendars, contacts, tasks,
notes, files, and bookmarks with the standards compliant components from the
Horde Project.

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, please see

The major changes compared to the Horde Groupware Webmail Edition version 5.2.3
are:

General changes:
    * Small bugfixes and improvements.

Calendar changes:
    * Fixed disclosure of private events in daily agenda.
    * Fixed adding and updating events via CalDAV.
    * Fixed incomplete month views.

Notes changes:
    * Fixed permission check when editing notes. Mitigation: the attacker needs
      to know the note's (random) URL to exploit this flaw.
    * Small API improvement.

Thanks to Christopher Neuhaus for reporting the security issue in the note
manager.</pre>
