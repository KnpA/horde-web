                        <p>The Horde team and community have spent more than
                        two years on developing the next generation of the
                        Horde Application Framework. A lot of work has been put
                        into modernizing the code libraries and the complete
                        application stack. New interfaces for modern browsers
                        and smartphones have been added. Existing functionality
                        has been improved further and new features have been
                        added to the most flexible web groupware solution
                        available.</p>
