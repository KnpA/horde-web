      <p>Oh No! You seem to be looking for a page that has been removed from
      our website. Probably because of one of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The page contained very outdated information and no longer applied.</li>
        <li>You've followed an outdated link form another website.</li>
        <li>Some other bizarre scenario that involves a warping of the
        space-time continuum. Don't panic.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Basically, the page or file isn't here. Here are some of our more
      interesting links. Hopefully what you seek may be found there.</p>
