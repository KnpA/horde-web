<ul class="simple">
<li>After kronolith gets support for different organizer/owner fields, must
properly set the organizer for meeting responses. Currently, the event
created from a meeting response does not contain the organizer of the original
event. So when the event is sync'd back to the device, it allows the user
to cancel the event and send updates to all attendees. Also, it will then be
possible to automatically add responses to the kronolith event from the
incoming activesync response message.</li>
<li>Implement better loop resolution. Need to remove the offending messages from
the change cache.</li>
<li>Implement &lt;SOFTDELETE&gt; command. This removes items from the device that fall
outside of the client's advertised timespan. This should only run once per
day .. probably on the first connection of the day, or perhaps a randomized
connection to lessen the chance of every user having this run at once.</li>
