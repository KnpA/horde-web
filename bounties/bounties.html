  <h3>Get Involved</h3>
  <div class="hint">
   <h3 style="text-align:center">Are you a developer?</h3>
        <p>You now have a chance to earn some money for your contributions.
        Look through the list of open bounties, pick one and solve it to
        claim your prize.</p>
        <p>Keep checking back here for new bounties or updates to
        sponsorships.</p>
        <p>If you do select a task to work on you may want to consider
        dropping a note to the <a href="http://lists.horde.org/mailman/listinfo/dev">dev mailing list</a>.
        If there are others that have selected the same task, at least
        you will get a chance to coordinate your efforts.</p>

   <h3 style="text-align:center">Do you wish to offer sponsorship?</h3>
        <p>Your contribution will be recognised with a logo and link to
        your site. We have two versions of sponsorship to choose from:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sponsor a bounty by pledging an amount towards a task. Your
              sponsorship will be visible until the bounty is claimed.
              Check the <a href="#bounties_available">table</a> for tasks
              awaiting sponsorship.</li>
          <li>Become a continuous sponsor by pledging a monthly
              amount. Your contribution will be distributed amongst various
              tasks and your logo kept visible for the duration of your
              sponsorship. Use this <a href="continuous.php">form</a> to
              contribute as a continuous sponsor.</li>

<h3>The hunt is on!</h3>
<p>If simply contributing to an Open Source project is not enough, you
now have an added incentive. The Horde Project has organized an
ongoing Bounty Hunt. Listed below are various tasks we would like to
see completed or features which have been requested. If you have
suggestions for possible bounties, look at the current list of <a
href="http://bugs.horde.org/query/enhancements"
target="_blank">enhancement requests</a> and <a
href="http://bugs.horde.org/ticket/create.php" target="_blank">submit
yours</a> if it is not already listed.</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>To successfully claim your prize you need to follow a few rules:</p>
<ol>
  <li>All code submitted for a bounty must be without any known intellectual
      property limitations. Furthermore, it must be submitted under the same
      <a href="<?php echo $base_url ?>/licenses/">license</a> as the
      application to which it will be applied (for example,
      <a href="<?php echo $base_url ?>/licenses/gpl.php">GPL</a> for IMP,
      <a href="<?php echo $base_url ?>/licenses/lgpl.php">LGPL</a> for
      Horde).</li>
  <li>The code must be accepted and committed into the development branch by
      the module's maintainers before any prize will be awarded.</li>
  <li>Patches must conform to Horde coding and style standards. The code must
      work and work elegantly (<i>i.e.</i>, no hack jobs).</li>
  <li>In the case of multiple submissions for a single bounty,  the judging
      panel will select and award the highest quality one.</li>
  <li>Group submissions must designate a lead person who will submit the claim
      on behalf of the group.</li>
  <li>All bounty awards or rejections are at the sole discretion of the judging
      panel. We may refuse to award a bounty to anyone for any reason at any
      time (although there will certainly be a valid reason, since it is in
      everyone's interest for the bounty process to work smoothly).</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have submitted your code and it has been accepted into
CVS, just let the developers who handled the patch know that you're
claiming the bounty. Prizes will be paid
using <a href="https://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a>.</p>
