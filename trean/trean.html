Trean is the Horde Bookmarks Management Application. Itallows you to store,
organize, manage, and most importantly access your web browser bookmarks
on-line and in one central place accessible from any web browser.

 By storing your bookmarks here, you can access them from any
 browser on any machine that can access the Horde applications.
 This means you can easily access your bookmarks from multiple browsers,
 multiple machines, remote locations, etc.  And if you upgrade, switch,
 or test out browsers, you don't have to worry about what happens to your
 bookmarks or how to import them into the new browser.
