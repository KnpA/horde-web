<p>There are many ways in which you can help out in the development of any of the
Horde projects. The first and best way you are already doing: you're using
them. One of the keys to a great product is its users. Without users we can't
find bugs or get feedback on what's good and what's bad.</p>
<p>It is darn near impossible for the developers to test the code on every
Operating System and every different version of Web Browser available to make
sure the code runs smoothly everywhere.  Linux is not Windows, and IE is not
Mozilla, and it is (frequently) difficult to to predict behavior between
platforms/browsers.</p>
<p>With this said, one of the best ways you can help is to test. If you can help
us smooth out the code across all (or even any) platforms, you're doing a
great service to the project.</p>
<p>Now, if that's not enough and you want to dig in and help code, you should
first subscribe to the project lists, particularly the general Horde
developers list <a class="reference external" href="mailto:dev&#64;lists.horde.org">dev&#64;lists.horde.org</a> (see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.horde.org/mail/">http://www.horde.org/mail/</a> for
information on subscribing to the mailing lists).  Additionally, you <strong>MUST</strong>
read the <a class="reference external" href="?f=CODING_STANDARDS.html">Horde Coding Standards</a> to ensure that the code your submitting
will want to be analyzed and potentially committed by the developers.  You
should probably read the various README files (for that matter, all the
documentation in the <tt class="docutils literal">docs/</tt> directory) for the particular application you
are working on also.</p>
