<p>This document contains instructions for installing the Jonah software
on your system.</p>
<p>For information on the capabilities and features of Jonah, see
the file README in the top-level directory of the distribution.</p>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="obtaining-jonah" name="obtaining-jonah">Obtaining Jonah</a></h1>
<p>Jonah can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at</p>

<a class="reference" href="ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/jonah/">ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/jonah/</a></blockquote>
<p>Bleeding-edge development versions of Jonah are available via CVS; see
the file docs/HACKING in the Horde distribution for information on
accessing the Horde CVS repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="prerequisites" name="prerequisites">PREREQUISITES</a></h1>
<p>To function properly, Jonah REQUIRES the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">A working Horde installation.</p>
<p>Jonah runs within the Horde Application Framework, a set of
common tools for Web applications written in PHP. You must
install Horde before installing Jonah.</p>
<p>The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and
FTP server, at</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a class="reference" href="http://www.horde.org/horde/">http://www.horde.org/horde/</a>
<a class="reference" href="ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/">ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of Jonah's prerequisites are also Horde prerequisites.
Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the INSTALL
file for the Horde Framework before installing Jonah.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The following PHP capabilities:</p>
<p>For the released tarball versions, you will require
a working php 3 or 4 install with working XML support
and fopen-wrappers enabled.</p>
<p>For the CVS version, you will require a working php version
4.2.0 or better, with XML and fopen-wrappers enabled.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="installing-jonah" name="installing-jonah">Installing Jonah</a></h1>
<p>Jonah is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible
directory. The precise location of this directory will differ from
system to system. Conventionally, Jonah is installed directly underneath
Horde in the web server's document tree.</p>
<p>Since Jonah is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary;
simply expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename
the root directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear
in the URL. For example, with the Apache web server's default document
root of '/usr/local/apache/htdocs', you would type:</p>
<blockquote>
cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
tar zxvf /path/to/jonah-0.0.2.tar.gz
mv jonah-0.0.2 jonah</blockquote>
<p>and would then find Jonah at the URL</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference" href="http://your-server/horde/jonah/">http://your-server/horde/jonah/</a></blockquote>
<p>At this point, you should probably point your browser at your Jonah's test
page at <a class="reference" href="http://your.server/horde/jonah/test.php">http://your.server/horde/jonah/test.php</a>. It will run some checks
on the version of php you're running, whether or not you have XML support,
miscellaneous php settings, and whether or not the config files are in the
right places.</p>
<p>Unless you've skipped ahead, it'll complain about not finding the config
files.  If no other problems are reported, continue on to the next section
on configuring Jonah.  If it finds other problems on the test page, you
should correct them first before proceeding.</p>

<p>You will first need to add a jonah stanza to your version of the

following stanza where appropriate (after the other entries like it

like):</p>

<blockquote>
If you have changed the location of Jonah relative to Horde,
either in the URL or in the file system or both, you must
update the 'fileroot' and/or 'webroot' settings to their correct
values.</blockquote>
<ol class="arabic" start="2">
<li><p class="first">Configuring Jonah</p>
<p>To configure Jonah, change to the config/ directory of the
installed distribution, and make copies of all of the configuration
&quot;dist&quot; files without the &quot;dist&quot; suffix.  An example of how to copy
the files on a unix based system is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cd config/
for foo in <a href="#id1" name="id2"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>.dist; do cp $foo <cite>basename $foo .dist</cite>; done</p>
<div class="system-message" id="id1">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: <a name="id1">WARNING/2</a> (<tt class="docutils">/home/jan/horde/jonah/docs/INSTALL</tt>, line 123); <em><a href="#id2">backlink</a></em></p>
<p>Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Documentation on the format and purpose of those files can be found in
each file.   You may edit these files if you wish to customize Jonah's
appearance and behavior.  The default values, while reasonable, may not
be appropriate for your site, so it is best to check them and make any
desired changes before proceeding.  Some important files and their
contents are:</p>
<p>You must then login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
configuration of Jonah.  Use the Horde &quot;Administration&quot; menu item to get
the the Administration page, and then on the click on the &quot;Configuration&quot;
icon to get the Configuration page.  Select &quot;Headlines&quot; from the selection
list of applications, and click on the &quot;Configure&quot; button.  Fill in or
change any configuration values as needed.  When done click on &quot;Generate
Headlines Configuration&quot; to generate the conf.php file.  If your web server
doesn't have write permissions to the Jonah configuration directory or
file, it will not be able to write the file.  In this case, cut and
paste the returned configuration information into the file
jonah/config/conf.php.</p>
<p>Note for international users:  Jonah uses GNU gettext to provide local
translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are
found in the po/ directory.  If a translation is not yet available
for your locale (and you wish to create one), or if you're having
trouble using a provided translation, please see the
horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS file for instructions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a). prefs.php</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This file contains all the preferences and their default values.
Reasons you might edit this are to change default values or to
lock preferences so the user can't change them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(b). templates.php</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This file defines the formatting templates used to display the
channels for various layout styles.  You will probably not want
to modify this file.</p>
