<p><font size="+2"><b>W</b></font>elcome to the Jonah homepage. Jonah is a set
of scripts, written in <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> and using the <a
href="../horde">Horde</a> framework, to manage content and
display for a portal-like site.</p>

<p><font size="+2"><b>R</b></font>ight now Jonah includes a backend
which will fetch RDF/RSS/syndicated XML site summary or headline
files, store them locally, parse them, and generate (and save) html
from them. My.Netscape style RSS files and My.UserLand XML storylist
files seem to both work. The frontend is extremely simplistic - it
lists the available channels and lets you view the generated html for
them. There's a really long list of channels available here: <a
href="http://www.syndic8.com/genfeed.php?Format=ocs">http://www.syndic8.com/genfeed.php?Format=ocs</a>.</p>

<p><font size="+2"><b>T</b></font>his is just the beginning - Jonah will
eventually have a complete my.netscape style portal frontend, and as many
backend content sources as people are interested in. But I'll need some help
for all that to happen, so...</p>

<p><font size="+2"><b>J</b></font>onah received a friendly mention in this
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developer/">IBM developerWorks</a> article entitled
"<a href="http://www-4.ibm.com/software/developer/library/php-xml-toolkit.html">
Essential tools and libraries for using XML with PHP</a>."</p>

<p><font size="+2"><b>D</b></font>ownload it from <a
href="<?php echo $ftp_base ?>/jonah/"><?php echo $ftp_base ?>/jonah/</a>
and let me know what you think, send me new channels, etc. There is a
mailing list at <?php mailto('jonah@lists.horde.org', 'jonah@lists.horde.org') ?> that
you can subscribe to for help or if you wish to help out with development
(see <a href="<?php echo $base_url ?>/mail/">here</a> for subscription
instructions). Finally, you can get/browse the latest code from <a href="<?php echo $base_url
