<div class="alert"><p>Note that we can only address problems related to the Horde
software itself. If you are having problems with any service <em>using</em>
Horde software, for example your email account, please contact your <b>service
provider</b> directly.</p></div>

<h4>Resources</h4>

<p>Just like the development of the Horde Project is a community and volunteer
effort, so is the support. Effort is made to provide the right tools to
efficiently help you with the resources available. Please use these tools fully
and intelligently.</p>

<div class="warning"><p>Please be careful not to have unreasonable expectations:
you cannot demand your questions to be answered, bugs to be fixed or features
implemented. If you require service or delivery guarantees please consider
hiring a <em>paid</em> <a href="consulting/">consultancy</a>.</p></div>

<p>As a starting point, please read the <a
href="http://wiki.horde.org/FAQ">Horde FAQ</a>. It is constantly updated from
all the other sources with the most frequently asked questions and the
responses.</p>

<h4>Mailing Lists and IRC</h4>

<p>You can address any support issues to one of the <a href="mail/">mailing
lists</a>. You can also ask for help on <a href="irc.php">IRC</a>.</p>

<div class="hint"><p>Note: your best bet for help is the mailing lists. There
are more people reading the mailing lists than the bug system email. The
more people that see your message, the more likely you are to get help. Make
sure to include
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">enough
information</a> so that people can help you.</p></div>

<h4>Bugs and Feature Requests</h4>

<p>If you have a bug or a new feature request, please visit the <a
href="http://bugs.horde.org/">Horde Bug Tracker</a>. Search first to see if
anyone has already filed a similar bug, if not open a new bug yourself.
Remember to use clear language, to be specific and verbose in your description.
Please read <a href="http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/149/">this
editorial</a> on writing good bug reports.</p>

<div class="warning"><p>Please remember: bug reports and any feedback help us
make Horde better over time (not necessarily tomorrow!) and are always
welcome.<br /> Strong language complaints and moaning on mailing lists, home
pages, news groups, and other places are not constructive. The first and only
place to file a complaint or feature request is in the <a
href="http://bugs.horde.org/">Horde Bug Tracker</a>. Do it anywhere else and
it will not reach the precious few who are willing to do anything about
it!</p></div>

<h4>Security Reports</h4>

<p>If you wish to report <b>security problems</b> please see the
procedures at <a
href="http://wiki.horde.org/SecurityManagement">http://wiki.horde.org/SecurityManagement</a>.</p>
