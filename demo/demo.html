<p>Providing a demo of Horde takes resources and time that are simply
not available to the project right now. Demos provided by 3rd parties
have been unreliable and unstable. Therefore there is no demo
available. We will do our best to provide screenshots, and simple
installations instructions are provided with Horde 3.0. Please feel
free to politely request screenshots of a particular application or
feature on the appropriate <a href="../mail/">mailing list</a>.</p>
