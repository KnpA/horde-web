<h1>Release notes for the latest release</h1><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Vacation
Auto-Responding Manager version H3 (3.2).

Vacation is a Horde module for managing user e-mail "vacation notices" or
"auto-responders." It works via a local vacation program and the .forward
style forwarding mechanism supported by several popular mailers.

Vacation provides fairly complete support for managing .forward style vacation
notices on Sendmail or Courier mail based systems via an FTP transport. It also
has some support for LDAP, Qmail, and Exim SQL based servers.

The major changes compared to the Vacation H3 (3.1) versions are:
    * Added Postfix Admin driver
    * Added TLS support to LDAP driver
    * Added support for output compression
    * Small improvements</pre>
