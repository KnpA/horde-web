<h1>Release notes for the latest release</h1><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Vacation
Auto-Responding Manager version H3 (3.0).

Vacation is a Horde module for managing user e-mail "vacation notices" or
"auto-responders." It works via a local vacation program and the .forward
style forwarding mechanism supported by several popular mailers.

Right now, Vacation provides fairly complete support for managing .forward
style vacation notices on Sendmail or Courier mail based systems via an FTP
transport. It also has some support for LDAP, Qmail, and Exim SQL based
servers.

The major changes compared to the Vacation H3 (3.0-RC1) version are:
    * Allow to set encryption type for SQL driver.
    * Fixed realm support.
    * Added Greek translation.
    * Updated Danish, German, and Italian translations.
    * Minor bug fixes.

The major changes compared to the Vacation 2.2 versions are:
    * Compatible with Horde 3 and PHP 5.
    * Show current vacation messsage.
    * Configurable default vacation message.
    * Added an LDAP driver.
    * Several driver improvements.
    * Added Bulgarian, Czech, and Persian translations.</pre>
