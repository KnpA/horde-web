<p>Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides a stable
and featureful individual calendar system for every Horde user, with
integrated collaboration/scheduling features.  It makes extensive use of the
<a href="../horde/">Horde Framework</a> to provide integration with other
applications.</p>

<p>Right now, Kronolith implements a solid, stand-alone calendar system,
allowing repeating events, all-day events, custom fields, keywords, shared
calendars, iCalendar support, generation of free/busy information, and
managing multiple users through Horde Authentication. The calendar API that
Kronolith uses is abstracted such that it could work with any backend, but
right now we provide SQL (abstracted to support most databases, including
MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MSSQL via <a
href="http://pear.php.net">PEAR</a> DB), and <a
href="http://www.kolab.org/">Kolab</a> backend libraries.</p>

<p>If you are interested in helping develop Kronolith, or just want to
ask questions and keep an eye on its progress, be sure to join our <a
href="../mail/">mailing list</a>!</p>
