<h3>What is Nag?</h3>

<p>Nag is a set of <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> scripts that
implement a simple, multiuser task list manager. It makes extensive
use of the Horde web application framework. The development
versions also support multiple task lists and sharing task lists
between users.</p>

<h3>What does it require?</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Absolute requirements</b>: A web server running a recent version of PHP
with support for a database with a PEAR driver, and recent (CVS or snapshot)
version of PEAR.</li>

<li><b>More or less absolute</b>: A browser capable of a reasonable level
of JavaScript and tables.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Where can I see the code?</h3>

<p>You can browse the current
<a href="http://cvs.horde.org/nag/">source tree</a> online.</p>
