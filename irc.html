<h3>Horde IRC</h3>

<p>There is a <tt>#horde</tt> channel on <tt>irc.freenode.net</tt> (<i>see</i>
<a href="http://www.freenode.net/">http://www.freenode.net/</a>),
for discussion of Horde applications, the Horde Framework, random
development questions, and anything else that seems relevant. Come
join us!</p>

<p>If you are coming to the channel for support, keep in mind that
your audience is limited and most are there working on development;
it's not a dedicated support channel.  Please be courteous, patient,
and understanding. As always with IRC, ask your question and be patient for an
answer. People are often busy or not even in front of the screen. Also, please
take a look at <a

Deliver a Report Without Getting Lynched</a> or ESR's <a
href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How To Ask
Questions The Smart Way</a>. It will help us help you.</p>
