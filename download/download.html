<li><p><em><strong>Stable Releases</strong></em> - code that has been tested,
documented, and possibly packaged in .rpm, .deb, or other
formats. Releases can be obtained from a project's download page. See the
<a href="../projects.php">Horde Project List</a> for a list of stable, or
soon-to-be released, applications.</p></li>

<li><p><em><strong>CVS Code</strong></em> - the latest code, either the bleeding
edge developer ("HEAD") releases, or the latest code on a <a
href="../source/modules.php">stable branch</a>. You can check out code
from <a href="../source/using.php">anonymous CVS</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><em><strong>Nightly Snapshots</strong></em> - tarballs of the bleeding-edge
developer code, generated nightly for those without access to CVS. We
keep approximately 7 days worth of snapshots, organized by date. <a
href="http://snaps.horde.org/">Snapshots are available</a> for all
<a href="../source/modules.php">applications in the Horde CVS repository</a>.</p></li>
