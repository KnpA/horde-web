<p><b>Swoosh</b>, as implied by its full name "SMS Web o o Services for Horde",
is an app to handle SMS traffic for Horde. It aims to be flexible enough to
handle any SMS gateway driver.</p>

<p>Swoosh is the one of the latest additions to the Horde suite of applications
and whilst being continuously worked on, at the moment the following features
are operational:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Setting up gateways, parameters and default send parameters - such as
       message type, delivery, sender ID;</li>
  <li> Sending of messages by typing in the destination number;</li>
  <li> Multiple recipient sending.</li>
</ul>

<p>The next goals for Swoosh development are to be able to link up to address
books such as <a href="../turba/">Turba</a> for selecting of users/groups,
message histories, account balances and batch templating.</p>
<p>Swoosh is currently only available from <a href="../source/"> CVS</a>. If you
wish to participate in its development or need any help join our
<a href="http://lists.horde.org/mailman/listinfo/swoosh">mailing list</a>.</p>
