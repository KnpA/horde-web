<h3>What is IMP?</h3>

<p>IMP is a set of <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> scripts that
implement an IMAP based webmail system. Assuming you have an account on a
server that supports IMAP, you can use an installation of IMP
to check your mail from anywhere that you have web access.
</p>

<h3>What does it require (IMP 4.x)?</h3>

<p>
<b>Absolute requirements</b>: A web server running PHP with IMAP support
(PHP 4.3.0 or later), a browser that supports cookies, and an IMAP account.
</p>

<p>
<b>More or less absolute</b> (ie, you'd have to do serious code revision to
get by without): A browser capable of a reasonable level of Javascript and
tables.
</p>

<p><b>Highly Recommended</b>: An SSL web server and a browser capable of the
same (this would only require minor code modification to get by without, but
still...), and PHP compiled into the server as a module.</p>

<p>For a complete list of install requirements, you should view the <a
href="<?php echo $base_url?>/imp/docs/?f=INSTALL.html">INSTALL</a> document
that is part of the distribution.</p>

<h3>Can I try it?</h3>

<p>We have a <a href="<?php echo $base_url?>/demo/">demonstration site</a>
available, running snapshots of the stable and development branches. Some of
the functions require a login. THERE IS NO GUEST LOGIN AT THIS TIME. Do not
ask for one. Instead, you will need to provide login details for an IMAP/POP3
account of your own.</p>
