Okay...attached is a "diff -u" file that patches the
mailbox.php3-message_summaries.inc file.  To activate
the trash can icon and the newmail icons, in conjunction
with the "D" and "U" flags, use the following options in
your "defaults.php3" file:

	$default->deleted_image = true;
	$default->unread_image  = true;

(and of course, "false" to turn off).
