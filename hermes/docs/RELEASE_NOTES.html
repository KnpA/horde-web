<h1>Release notes for the latest release</h1><pre>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of
Hermes version H3 (1.0).

Hermes is a time tracking and reporting application written for the Horde
Framework.  Taking advantage of the Framework for authentication and
presentation, it integrates seamlessly with other Horde applications allowing
users to track time against To Do items (from Mnemo), Tickets (from Whups), or
pre-configured projects within Hermes itself.  The list of billable clients is
taken from the Address Book (Turba).  Additionally, there is an OS X
Widget to allow Mac users to enter time directly from his or her Dashboard.

This is a preview version that should not be used on production systems. This
version is considered feature complete but a few bugs may still exist in the
code.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the final release.  We also need improved online help
and a more recent screenshots for the website.

This is the initial Release Candidate for the 1.0 version of Hermes.</pre>
