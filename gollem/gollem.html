<p>Gollem is the Horde web-based File Manager, providing the ability to fully
manage a hierarchical file system stored in a variety of backends such as a
SQL database, as part of a real filesystem, or on an FTP server. It uses the
<a href="../horde/">Horde's</a> MIME_Viewer framework to identify file types,
associate icons, etc.</p>

<p>If you are interested in helping develop Gollem, or just want to ask
questions and keep an eye on its progress, be sure to join our <a
